{"pageProps":{"content":"<h3>Questioning the White Press: How They Upheld the Racial Hierarchy through Their Coverage of Jesse Owens</h3>\n<p>A History 300 Paper</p>\n<p>In the face of one of history’s most oppressive regimes, Jesse Owens rose to greatness at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, delivering a legendary athletic performance that challenged racial stereotypes and exposed the ugly truth about racism in America. Due to the political climate of Nazi Germany, concerns arose surrounding how non-Aryan athletes would be treated, and the United States debated whether they would participate. After careful deliberation, they chose to send a team of 312, including 12 African Americans.<sup>1</sup> These Black athletes represented the country on the global stage, defying the stereotypes that they were not suited for sports. Among them, Jesse Owens garnered the most attention, winning gold medals in the broad jump, 100-meter dash, 200-meter dash, and 4x100-meter relay. Particularly because it challenged the notion of Black inferiority prevalent at the time, his success raised a crucial question for the American media: how would they frame his achievements? Contrasting the Black press’s coverage of the 1936 Olympics against the coverage by the southern white press reveals that the white press dismissed Jesse Owens’ achievements, using media to perpetrate harmful stereotypes about Black athletes and uphold the existing racial hierarchy in the United States.</p>\n<p>Due to the pervasive racism and political tension of the era, the media struggled to frame Owens’ success and reconcile his victories with the existing dominant racial hierarchy. After the International Olympic Committee decided to host the games in Berlin, the German government underwent a dramatic change with Hitler in power, promoting Aryanism which declared Germans as the superior race and blamed “inferior” races, including Jewish and Black people, for all of the country’s problems.<sup>2</sup> In the United States, a significant number of white Americans still held racist views, which the segregation within sports with separated training, competition, and funding reflected.<sup>3</sup> However, <em>The Crisis</em> argued that Americans appreciated athletic accomplishment more than intellectual genius, and performances by athletes held more sway with the public than academics and writers did. The magazine saw this “interracial education” as having the potential to solve the race problem.<sup>4</sup> Thus, the framing of Jesse Owens’ achievements at the Olympics raised questions about how media outlets would portray his success given the political climate of the time. The contrast between German and American views on race and the potential for Owens’ accomplishments to shape the race problem in the United States underscored the significance of his performance beyond the realm of athletics.</p>\n<p>The coverage of the Olympics by the Black press demonstrated a strong commitment to celebrating athletes of color and highlighting the successes of African Americans. Before the Olympics, many people of color believed that sending African American athletes to Germany would allow them to debunk Nazi racial beliefs and disprove the stereotypes against Black people in the United States by dominating the competition.<sup>5</sup> Thus, the Black press proudly displayed the achievements of Owens and other African American athletes during the Olympics. Just under two weeks after Owens won his four gold medals, the <em>Afro-American</em> published an article titled “8 World Marks by Jess Owens Meet Approval: International Body Accepts Old and Olympic Record.<sup>6</sup> This highlighted his individual success, displaying all of his records — eight in total including the ones he ran in preliminary rounds — and giving him his own article for his achievements. For the whole month of August, Black newspapers across the country showcased Owens, and when claims circulated that Hitler had refused to shake Owens’ hand, <em>The New York Amsterdam News</em>, a popular Black newspaper, published an article headlined “Our own Jesse Owens whose achievements is the most outstanding of the entire games thus far, got only a half-hearted and wholly un-Nazi salute from the Chancellor.” They intentionally referred to him as “our own” to claim him as part of their race and his achievement as an achievement for all Black people in the United States.<sup>7</sup> In addition, they fought for his full acknowledgment with the second part of the headline, arguing that his impressive feat deserved recognition from everyone.</p>\n<p>Prior to the Olympics, despite their near-unanimous vocal criticism of Nazi Germany’s treatment of non-Aryan athletes, the white American press consciously avoided addressing the issue of racism within their own country, creating a climate of evasion that was at odds with the increasing visibility of Black athletes on the world stage. In the lead-up to the games, many Americans hesitated to support the event due to the politics in Nazi Germany and quickly organized a boycott. An article in <em>The Rapid City Journal</em> stated the “Olympic games ‘will not be held in any country where there will be interference with the fundamental Olympic theory of equality for all races.’”<sup>8</sup> Though the Nazis discriminated against both Black and Jewish people, the press focused on their hostility against Jews as the reason to boycott.<sup>9</sup> They ignored the racism against Black people because criticizing that would be hypocritical. In tandem with this, white newspapers hardly ever commented on the U.S.’s segregation of Black athletes.<sup>10</sup> Some even refused to acknowledge the racism in Germany. One article by <em>The Sun</em> affirmed that “there was no evidence… of racial or religious discrimination [in Germany], as boycott advocates had charged.”<sup>11</sup> The assertion that there was no evidence of racial discrimination in Germany completely contradicts the reports from athletes and observers who witnessed the Nazis’ prejudiced actions. Clearly this was a radical paper, yet this denial of reality not only perpetuated false beliefs but also disregarded the experiences of the Black athletes who faced discrimination in their own country. By pushing racism aside, they aimed to detach the Olympics from race, and thus prevent any discussion of race in the U.S. and avoid revealing their racial segregation.</p>\n<p>Alongside dodging any discussion of America’s racial issues, the southern white press claimed Owens’ triumphs as patriotic victories for America and obscured his Black achievement, implicitly furthering their agenda of white supremacy. By labeling Owens as an “American Hero” yet never printing a picture of him, the press ignored his race and claimed his success as a victory for the entire country.<sup>12</sup> Instead of highlighting Owens’ historic accomplishments, they focused on the team’s overall success. They deemed him a hero not for redefining greatness — both through the lens of medals and for what a Black athlete could achieve — but rather for scoring points for the U.S. team. Days apart from the aforementioned Black newspaper articles, the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> published an article headlined “Owens — U.S. Captures 3 More Events; Increases Lead.”<sup>13</sup> Unlike the Black papers, they mentioned no records, and the article itself focused on the team’s total points and standing.<sup>14</sup> By doing this, they diminished his individual accomplishments and diverted the attention to how great the U.S. team was doing. Diverting attention away from a Black athlete’s accomplishments was a common tactic used by the white press.<sup>15</sup> A headline from <em>The Sun</em>, “Japanese Wins Marathon; U.S. Takes Relay,” placed the Japanese win — something insignificant to Americans — ahead of the U.S. team’s relay victory, which included two Black athletes.<sup>16</sup> Only in the subtitle did they mention that Owens had won four gold medals, the first American to ever do so.<sup>17</sup> When a win highlighted Black achievement, they obscured it and drew attention away from it, furthering their agenda of white supremacy.</p>\n<p>The white press’s coverage of Owens revealed a culture of exploitation where corporations solely used African American athletes for profit. For many, recognition by the white media was not a concern, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s intention of having Black athletes represent the team was to improve the country’s public relations by painting the country as diverse and inclusive.<sup>18</sup> The reality, however, was that the United States mistreated even the Black athletes they sent. After the Olympics, the director of the A.A.U. sent Owens and his team on a track “tour” across Europe. This was solely a means for the association to exploit the fame of the athletes for profit, however, as they gave the athletes no pay or food.<sup>19</sup> Near the end of this tour, <em>The Boston Daily Globe</em> published an article headlined “Owens Suspended by A.A.U. on Charge of ‘Running Out’: Negro Cancels Scheduled Swedish Trip to Sail Home and Weigh Money Offers.”<sup>20</sup> This portrayed Owens as money-hungry and irresponsible, but failed to mention that he was unpaid and struggling to make ends meet. Though the press tried to cover it up, corporations exploited Owens for money. Upon returning home, many of the public offers Owens received through the media from the movie industry, vaudeville tour, and nightclub were simply cynical attempts to gain publicity.<sup>21</sup> The media revealed how American corporations exploited Owens and other Black athletes for profits and pushed them into publicly weak positions that reflected poorly upon their character, upholding the racial hierarchy.</p>\n<p>The white press and Black press’s portrayals of Jesse Owens’ success at the 1936 Berlin Olympics were starkly different, with the white press diminishing his individual records to wins for the country in order to perpetuate racial inequality and uphold the hierarchical structures of American society. By ignoring Owens’ race and the realities of racism within the United States, the white press demonstrated how media can be used to distort and manipulate public perception. The media’s exploitation of Owens for profit exposed the darker side of American exceptionalism and underscores the need for a more critical and nuanced understanding of the role of the media in shaping public discourse. The legacy of the 1936 Olympics serves as a poignant reminder of the ways in which media can be used to oppress marginalized communities and stymie the fight for justice and equality in the United States.</p>\n<section class=\"endnotes\">\n<h3 class=\"endnotes-title\">Endnotes</h3>\n<ol class=\"endnote-list\">\n  <li>Liz Sonneborn, \"Overview: Jesse Owens and the 1936 Berlin Olympics,\" in <em>Jesse Owens and the 1936 Berlin Olympics</em> (n.p.: Facts On File, 2023), n.p., http://proxy5.noblenet.org/login?url=https://online.infobase.com/Auth/Index?aid=16412&itemid=WE01&articleId=648498.</li>\n  <li>Sonneborn, \"Overview: Jesse,\" n.p..</li>\n  <li>David Clay Large, \"'Darktown Parade': African Americans in the Berlin Olympics of 1936,\" <em>The Johns Hopkins University Press: Historically Speaking</em> 9, no. 2 (December 2007): 7, https://muse.jhu.edu/article/422940/pdf.</li>\n  <li>Mark Dyreson, \"Jesse Owens: Leading Man in Modern American Tales of Racial Progress and Limits,\" in <em>Out of the Shadows: A Biographical History of African American Athletes</em> (n.p.: University of Arkansas Press, 2020), n.p., online.infobase.com/Auth/Index?aid=16412&itemid=WE01&articleId=599387.</li>\n  <li>Large, \"'Darktown Parade,'\" 7.</li>\n  <li>\"8 World-Marks by Jess Owens Meet Approval: International B O D Y Accepts Old and Olympic Records.
