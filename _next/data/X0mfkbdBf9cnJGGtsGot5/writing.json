This is not a mere oversight, but a manifestation of a web of cultural factors, including the dominance of White sport, deeply ingrained stereotypes that cloud Asian American athleticism, and cultural misconceptions that continue to thrive. This underrepresentation is felt keenly by those in the sport. As a national-level runner, I experienced this firsthand. During a period of injury last year, I grappled with a palpable lack of visible Asian-American-runner role models, which added an additional layer of challenge to my journey back. In 2021, a mere 1.86% of collegiate cross-country runners identified as Asian American, a statistic that is as disheartening as it is revealing (NCAA Research). This lack of involvement not only poses an issue of **injustice**, but an issue of health, as low physical activity in Asian teens, specifically, is tied to “higher presence … of high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol,” and mental health issues such as depression (Diep et al. 1-2). The juxtaposition of American distance running against the running **culture** of Japan sheds light on the underexplored terrain of cultural differences in sporting practices and how these can illuminate pathways to foster greater inclusivity in running.\n\nThe stark lack of Asian American presence in distance running is a clear manifestation of the pervasive dominance of White sport in America. In the NCAA, a paltry 2% of athletes identify as Asian, a percentage that dwindles even lower for cross-country distance running, to a mere 250 Asian American runners out of a total of 13,442 in 2021 (NCAA Research). This underrepresentation permeates beyond the physical tracks and trails into the virtual realm of social media, a space that could potentially offer differing perspectives, yet often mirrors the biases of the real world. FloTrack, a popular Instagram platform boasting 360,000 followers, falls victim to this, as an analysis of their content over the last six months reveals that they featured Asian runners a scant three times amidst 379 posts (FloTrack). \n\nAt a cursory glance, it may seem like Asians just prioritize academics over athletics. This could induce stress and explain the chilling reality of their higher depression rates compared to their white counterparts (Tran 11). Asians excelling in school falls right under the ‘Model Minority’ Myth (Zimmerman). They are perceived as studious, successful, and smart, but unathletic. Their lack of visibility can further be ignorantly attributed to lack of talent; this would elucidate why FloTrack does not often feature them in their “**exclusive** content” (FloTrack). \n\nThe truth, however, is that many Asian Americans want to run. The narrative of Asian American disinterest in physical activity is belied by the actions of individuals like Leland Yu, who, over the pandemic, used distance running as a platform to support the Chinatown **community** (Chan). On a broader scale, a study on Chinese-American youth found that those with “positive social support were almost eleven times more likely to engage in vigorous physical activity than participants perceiving negative social support,” showing that many do have the willingness to participate (Zhang and DeBate 1). Along with the desire to run, they can also perform well. Asian-born runners like Miki Gorman, two-time New York City Marathon and Boston Marathon winner, and Yuki Kawauchi, the first to run 100 marathons under 2:20, have found great success on the global stage (Chan). Asian American runners have the genetic potential to excel if given the opportunity. The notion that all Asian Americans value academics over athletics or are naturally not suited for sports is wrong, and it is just another stereotype that compounds their underrepresentation in distance running and the lack of attention to the issue.\n\nWhy, then, is it that Asian athletes are seeing success, while Asian Americans are stuck struggling for visibility? Against the American backdrop, Japanese running culture offers a striking contrast that lends itself to the answer. The culture of Japanese distance running is marked by camaraderie and team spirit (Adharanand 11). Key to this is the **Ekiden**, a relay-style race deeply embedded in Japanese running culture. Unlike the typically solitary sport of long-distance running, the Ekiden is a cherished tradition that transforms the activity into a communal, team-driven event (Adharanand 11). It is so popular that, “while US marathon broadcasts rarely creep above 1% ratings, in Japan a 10% rating for a major ekiden or marathon would be a disappointment” (Adharanand 11). This celebration of collective spirit and unity is what the United States is missing.\n\nThe issue is not lack of willingness but rather lack of support for Asian Americans. One study found “environmental influences” to be the leading cause of Asian Americans not participating in sports (Zhang and DeBate 2). Another study supplemented this, stating that “[s]tudent-athlete status appeared to be most consistently beneficial for White student-athletes” and that “Asian/Pacific Island student-athletes did not appear to be benefited by student-athlete status” (Tran 1). Largely in school environments, Asian American teen athletes are **tokenized** and excluded. Instead of supporting them, their peers often **target** them. As runner and activist Ben Chan poignantly recalled in his podcast episode: when he moved to a new school as a child, he realized, “‘[Everyone] ha[d] a common target, and that was me’” (Zimmerman). This constant othering can lead to depression. Research in 2012 showed that Asian student-athletes “exhibited a higher rate of suicidal ideation (9.6%) compared to White student-athletes (4.8%)” (Tran 11). The sad truth is that America fails to provide a supportive community for Asian runners. \n\nThe underrepresentation of Asian Americans in distance running is not a simple issue of individual choices, but a complex interplay of societal factors like the dominance of White sport, pervasive stereotypes, and cultural misunderstandings. To challenge this disparity, we must draw inspiration from the Japanese running culture and focus on community-building initiatives. Additionally, it is crucial that we form bonds of solidarity with other marginalized minority groups, supporting each other in our shared pursuit of equality in sports. Through conscious efforts to challenge stereotypes, foster community, and uplift each other, we can aspire to transform the sport of distance running, creating a community that not only welcomes but celebrates the diversity of its participants.\n\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/img/posts/aapi-fig-1.jpg\" class=\"post-image-full\" alt=\"Figure 1: NCAA Demographics Dashboard\"/>\n  <figcaption class=\"post-image-caption\">\n    <strong class=\"figure-label\">Figure&nbsp;1.</strong><br />\n    <span class=\"figure-cite\">\n      NCAA Research. \"Demographics Dashboard.\" <em>NCAA Demographics Database</em>, NCAA, Dec. 2022, www.ncaa.org/sports/2018/12/13/ncaa-demographics-database.aspx. \"Demographics by Race/Ethnicity, Students: Student-Athletes.\"\n    </span>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/img/posts/aapi-fig-2.jpg\" class=\"post-image-full\" alt=\"NCAA XC Demographics Dashboard\">\n  <figcaption class=\"post-image-caption\">\n    <strong class=\"figure-label\">Figure&nbsp;2.</strong><br />\n    <span class=\"figure-cite\">\n      NCAA Research. \"Demographics Dashboard.\" <em>NCAA Demographics Database</em>, NCAA, Dec. 2022, www.ncaa.org/sports/2018/12/13/ncaa-demographics-database.aspx. \"Table View: Coach and Student-Athlete Demographics by Sport, Cross Country.\"\n    </span>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/static/img/posts/aapi-fig-3.jpg\" class=\"post-image-full\" width = '50%' alt=\"FloTrack Instagram Page\">\n  <figcaption class=\"post-image-caption\">\n    <strong class=\"figure-label\">Figure&nbsp;3.</strong><br />\n    <span class=\"figure-cite\">\n      FloTrack [flotrack]. \"Live Track and XC Events.

Due to the political climate of Nazi Germany, concerns arose surrounding how non-Aryan athletes would be treated, and the United States debated whether they would participate. After careful deliberation, they chose to send a team of 312, including 12 African Americans.<sup>1</sup> These Black athletes represented the country on the global stage, defying the stereotypes that they were not suited for sports. Among them, Jesse Owens garnered the most attention, winning gold medals in the broad jump, 100-meter dash, 200-meter dash, and 4x100-meter relay. Particularly because it challenged the notion of Black inferiority prevalent at the time, his success raised a crucial question for the American media: how would they frame his achievements? Contrasting the Black press’s coverage of the 1936 Olympics against the coverage by the southern white press reveals that the white press dismissed Jesse Owens’ achievements, using media to perpetrate harmful stereotypes about Black athletes and uphold the existing racial hierarchy in the United States.\n\nDue to the pervasive racism and political tension of the era, the media struggled to frame Owens’ success and reconcile his victories with the existing dominant racial hierarchy. After the International Olympic Committee decided to host the games in Berlin, the German government underwent a dramatic change with Hitler in power, promoting Aryanism which declared Germans as the superior race and blamed “inferior” races, including Jewish and Black people, for all of the country’s problems.<sup>2</sup> In the United States, a significant number of white Americans still held racist views, which the segregation within sports with separated training, competition, and funding reflected.<sup>3</sup> However, <em>The Crisis</em> argued that Americans appreciated athletic accomplishment more than intellectual genius, and performances by athletes held more sway with the public than academics and writers did. The magazine saw this “interracial education” as having the potential to solve the race problem.<sup>4</sup> Thus, the framing of Jesse Owens’ achievements at the Olympics raised questions about how media outlets would portray his success given the political climate of the time. The contrast between German and American views on race and the potential for Owens’ accomplishments to shape the race problem in the United States underscored the significance of his performance beyond the realm of athletics.\n\nThe coverage of the Olympics by the Black press demonstrated a strong commitment to celebrating athletes of color and highlighting the successes of African Americans. Before the Olympics, many people of color believed that sending African American athletes to Germany would allow them to debunk Nazi racial beliefs and disprove the stereotypes against Black people in the United States by dominating the competition.<sup>5</sup> Thus, the Black press proudly displayed the achievements of Owens and other African American athletes during the Olympics. Just under two weeks after Owens won his four gold medals, the <em>Afro-American</em> published an article titled “8 World Marks by Jess Owens Meet Approval: International Body Accepts Old and Olympic Record.<sup>6</sup> This highlighted his individual success, displaying all of his records — eight in total including the ones he ran in preliminary rounds — and giving him his own article for his achievements. For the whole month of August, Black newspapers across the country showcased Owens, and when claims circulated that Hitler had refused to shake Owens’ hand, <em>The New York Amsterdam News</em>, a popular Black newspaper, published an article headlined “Our own Jesse Owens whose achievements is the most outstanding of the entire games thus far, got only a half-hearted and wholly un-Nazi salute from the Chancellor.” They intentionally referred to him as “our own” to claim him as part of their race and his achievement as an achievement for all Black people in the United States.<sup>7</sup> In addition, they fought for his full acknowledgment with the second part of the headline, arguing that his impressive feat deserved recognition from everyone.\n\nPrior to the Olympics, despite their near-unanimous vocal criticism of Nazi Germany’s treatment of non-Aryan athletes, the white American press consciously avoided addressing the issue of racism within their own country, creating a climate of evasion that was at odds with the increasing visibility of Black athletes on the world stage. In the lead-up to the games, many Americans hesitated to support the event due to the politics in Nazi Germany and quickly organized a boycott. An article in <em>The Rapid City Journal</em> stated the “Olympic games ‘will not be held in any country where there will be interference with the fundamental Olympic theory of equality for all races.’”<sup>8</sup> Though the Nazis discriminated against both Black and Jewish people, the press focused on their hostility against Jews as the reason to boycott.<sup>9</sup> They ignored the racism against Black people because criticizing that would be hypocritical. In tandem with this, white newspapers hardly ever commented on the U.S.’s segregation of Black athletes.<sup>10</sup> Some even refused to acknowledge the racism in Germany. One article by <em>The Sun</em> affirmed that “there was no evidence… of racial or religious discrimination [in Germany], as boycott advocates had charged.”<sup>11</sup> The assertion that there was no evidence of racial discrimination in Germany completely contradicts the reports from athletes and observers who witnessed the Nazis’ prejudiced actions. Clearly this was a radical paper, yet this denial of reality not only perpetuated false beliefs but also disregarded the experiences of the Black athletes who faced discrimination in their own country. By pushing racism aside, they aimed to detach the Olympics from race, and thus prevent any discussion of race in the U.S. and avoid revealing their racial segregation.\n\nAlongside dodging any discussion of America’s racial issues, the southern white press claimed Owens’ triumphs as patriotic victories for America and obscured his Black achievement, implicitly furthering their agenda of white supremacy. By labeling Owens as an “American Hero” yet never printing a picture of him, the press ignored his race and claimed his success as a victory for the entire country.<sup>12</sup> Instead of highlighting Owens’ historic accomplishments, they focused on the team’s overall success. They deemed him a hero not for redefining greatness — both through the lens of medals and for what a Black athlete could achieve — but rather for scoring points for the U.S. team. Days apart from the aforementioned Black newspaper articles, the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> published an article headlined “Owens — U.S. Captures 3 More Events; Increases Lead.”<sup>13</sup> Unlike the Black papers, they mentioned no records, and the article itself focused on the team’s total points and standing.<sup>14</sup> By doing this, they diminished his individual accomplishments and diverted the attention to how great the U.S. team was doing. Diverting attention away from a Black athlete’s accomplishments was a common tactic used by the white press.<sup>15</sup> A headline from <em>The Sun</em>, “Japanese Wins Marathon; U.S. Takes Relay,” placed the Japanese win — something insignificant to Americans — ahead of the U.S. team’s relay victory, which included two Black athletes.<sup>16</sup> Only in the subtitle did they mention that Owens had won four gold medals, the first American to ever do so.<sup>17</sup> When a win highlighted Black achievement, they obscured it and drew attention away from it, furthering their agenda of white supremacy.\n\nThe white press’s coverage of Owens revealed a culture of exploitation where corporations solely used African American athletes for profit. For many, recognition by the white media was not a concern, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s intention of having Black athletes represent the team was to improve the country’s public relations by painting the country as diverse and inclusive.<sup>18</sup> The reality, however, was that the United States mistreated even the Black athletes they sent. After the Olympics, the director of the A.A.U. sent Owens and his team on a track “tour” across Europe. This was solely a means for the association to exploit the fame of the athletes for profit, however, as they gave the athletes no pay or food.<sup>19</sup> Near the end of this tour, <em>The Boston Daily Globe</em> published an article headlined “Owens Suspended by A.A.U. on Charge of ‘Running Out’: Negro Cancels Scheduled Swedish Trip to Sail Home and Weigh Money Offers.”<sup>20</sup> This portrayed Owens as money-hungry and irresponsible, but failed to mention that he was unpaid and struggling to make ends meet. Though the press tried to cover it up, corporations exploited Owens for money. Upon returning home, many of the public offers Owens received through the media from the movie industry, vaudeville tour, and nightclub were simply cynical attempts to gain publicity.<sup>21</sup> The media revealed how American corporations exploited Owens and other Black athletes for profits and pushed them into publicly weak positions that reflected poorly upon their character, upholding the racial hierarchy.\n\nThe white press and Black press’s portrayals of Jesse Owens’ success at the 1936 Berlin Olympics were starkly different, with the white press diminishing his individual records to wins for the country in order to perpetuate racial inequality and uphold the hierarchical structures of American society. By ignoring Owens’ race and the realities of racism within the United States, the white press demonstrated how media can be used to distort and manipulate public perception. The media’s exploitation of Owens for profit exposed the darker side of American exceptionalism and underscores the need for a more critical and nuanced understanding of the role of the media in shaping public discourse. The legacy of the 1936 Olympics serves as a poignant reminder of the ways in which media can be used to oppress marginalized communities and stymie the fight for justice and equality in the United States.\n\n<section class=\"endnotes\">\n\n<h3 class=\"endnotes-title\">Endnotes</h3>\n\n<ol class=\"endnote-list\">\n  <li>Liz Sonneborn, \"Overview: Jesse Owens and the 1936 Berlin Olympics,\" in <em>Jesse Owens and the 1936 Berlin Olympics</em> (n.p.: Facts On File, 2023), n.p., http://proxy5.noblenet.org/login?url=https://online.infobase.com/Auth/Index?aid=16412&itemid=WE01&articleId=648498.</li>\n  <li>Sonneborn, \"Overview: Jesse,\" n.p..</li>\n  <li>David Clay Large, \"'Darktown Parade': African Americans in the Berlin Olympics of 1936,\" <em>The Johns Hopkins University Press: Historically Speaking</em> 9, no. 2 (December 2007): 7, https://muse.jhu.edu/article/422940/pdf.</li>\n  <li>Mark Dyreson, \"Jesse Owens: Leading Man in Modern American Tales of Racial Progress and Limits,\" in <em>Out of the Shadows: A Biographical History of African American Athletes</em> (n.p.: University of Arkansas Press, 2020), n.p., online.infobase.com/Auth/Index?aid=16412&itemid=WE01&articleId=599387.</li>\n  <li>Large, \"'Darktown Parade,'\" 7.</li>\n  <li>\"8 World-Marks by Jess Owens Meet Approval: International B O D Y Accepts Old and Olympic Records.
