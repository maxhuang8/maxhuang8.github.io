{"pageProps":{"title":"Running // Max Huang","description":"I am a <strong>distance runner</strong> at heart. Although I was a soccer player for much of my life, I have been racing local 5ks since I was 8 years old, and throughout high school, I <strong>fell in love</strong> with running. I now compete at the <strong>NCAA level</strong>, racing for the Maroons. Though I thrive on the competition, it is the <strong>simple joy</strong> of running that makes me love the sport.","tagline":"Comraderie and Competition","image":"/static/images/running-bw.jpg","primaryColor":"purple","secondaryColor":"cyan"},"__N_SSG":true}
