### A Blank Reflection: Asian Americans in Distance Running

Despite the rich mosaic of talent that defines the United States, a profound underrepresentation of Asian Americans persists in the arena of distance running. This is not a mere oversight, but a manifestation of a web of cultural factors, including the dominance of White sport, deeply ingrained stereotypes that cloud Asian American athleticism, and cultural misconceptions that continue to thrive. This underrepresentation is felt keenly by those in the sport. As a national-level runner, I experienced this firsthand. During a period of injury last year, I grappled with a palpable lack of visible Asian-American-runner role models, which added an additional layer of challenge to my journey back. In 2021, a mere 1.86% of collegiate cross-country runners identified as Asian American, a statistic that is as disheartening as it is revealing (NCAA Research). This lack of involvement not only poses an issue of **injustice**, but an issue of health, as low physical activity in Asian teens, specifically, is tied to “higher presence … of high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol,” and mental health issues such as depression (Diep et al. 1-2). The juxtaposition of American distance running against the running **culture** of Japan sheds light on the underexplored terrain of cultural differences in sporting practices and how these can illuminate pathways to foster greater inclusivity in running.

The stark lack of Asian American presence in distance running is a clear manifestation of the pervasive dominance of White sport in America. In the NCAA, a paltry 2% of athletes identify as Asian, a percentage that dwindles even lower for cross-country distance running, to a mere 250 Asian American runners out of a total of 13,442 in 2021 (NCAA Research). This underrepresentation permeates beyond the physical tracks and trails into the virtual realm of social media, a space that could potentially offer differing perspectives, yet often mirrors the biases of the real world. FloTrack, a popular Instagram platform boasting 360,000 followers, falls victim to this, as an analysis of their content over the last six months reveals that they featured Asian runners a scant three times amidst 379 posts (FloTrack). 

At a cursory glance, it may seem like Asians just prioritize academics over athletics. This could induce stress and explain the chilling reality of their higher depression rates compared to their white counterparts (Tran 11). Asians excelling in school falls right under the ‘Model Minority’ Myth (Zimmerman). They are perceived as studious, successful, and smart, but unathletic. Their lack of visibility can further be ignorantly attributed to lack of talent; this would elucidate why FloTrack does not often feature them in their “**exclusive** content” (FloTrack). 

The truth, however, is that many Asian Americans want to run. The narrative of Asian American disinterest in physical activity is belied by the actions of individuals like Leland Yu, who, over the pandemic, used distance running as a platform to support the Chinatown **community** (Chan). On a broader scale, a study on Chinese-American youth found that those with “positive social support were almost eleven times more likely to engage in vigorous physical activity than participants perceiving negative social support,” showing that many do have the willingness to participate (Zhang and DeBate 1). Along with the desire to run, they can also perform well. Asian-born runners like Miki Gorman, two-time New York City Marathon and Boston Marathon winner, and Yuki Kawauchi, the first to run 100 marathons under 2:20, have found great success on the global stage (Chan). Asian American runners have the genetic potential to excel if given the opportunity. The notion that all Asian Americans value academics over athletics or are naturally not suited for sports is wrong, and it is just another stereotype that compounds their underrepresentation in distance running and the lack of attention to the issue.

Why, then, is it that Asian athletes are seeing success, while Asian Americans are stuck struggling for visibility? Against the American backdrop, Japanese running culture offers a striking contrast that lends itself to the answer. The culture of Japanese distance running is marked by camaraderie and team spirit (Adharanand 11). Key to this is the **Ekiden**, a relay-style race deeply embedded in Japanese running culture. Unlike the typically solitary sport of long-distance running, the Ekiden is a cherished tradition that transforms the activity into a communal, team-driven event (Adharanand 11). It is so popular that, “while US marathon broadcasts rarely creep above 1% ratings, in Japan a 10% rating for a major ekiden or marathon would be a disappointment” (Adharanand 11). This celebration of collective spirit and unity is what the United States is missing.

The issue is not lack of willingness but rather lack of support for Asian Americans. One study found “environmental influences” to be the leading cause of Asian Americans not participating in sports (Zhang and DeBate 2). Another study supplemented this, stating that “[s]tudent-athlete status appeared to be most consistently beneficial for White student-athletes” and that “Asian/Pacific Island student-athletes did not appear to be benefited by student-athlete status” (Tran 1). Largely in school environments, Asian American teen athletes are **tokenized** and excluded. Instead of supporting them, their peers often **target** them. As runner and activist Ben Chan poignantly recalled in his podcast episode: when he moved to a new school as a child, he realized, “‘[Everyone] ha[d] a common target, and that was me’” (Zimmerman). This constant othering can lead to depression. Research in 2012 showed that Asian student-athletes “exhibited a higher rate of suicidal ideation (9.6%) compared to White student-athletes (4.8%)” (Tran 11). The sad truth is that America fails to provide a supportive community for Asian runners. 

The underrepresentation of Asian Americans in distance running is not a simple issue of individual choices, but a complex interplay of societal factors like the dominance of White sport, pervasive stereotypes, and cultural misunderstandings. To challenge this disparity, we must draw inspiration from the Japanese running culture and focus on community-building initiatives. Additionally, it is crucial that we form bonds of solidarity with other marginalized minority groups, supporting each other in our shared pursuit of equality in sports. Through conscious efforts to challenge stereotypes, foster community, and uplift each other, we can aspire to transform the sport of distance running, creating a community that not only welcomes but celebrates the diversity of its participants.

      Injustice: “‘Have you always been really focused on exposing injustice?’”
      <br>
      <em>Definition:</em> “Injustice” is commonly understood as unjust action, unfairness, and/or discrimination experienced by a particular group (OED). However, it extends beyond just that. In American distance running, “injustice” refers to not only the overt acts of discrimination but also the systemic barriers that hinder the visibility and ultimately progress of Asian American runners. It encompasses the historical and ongoing struggles faced by Asian American athletes in overcoming these obstacles, as well as the impact of such injustices on their mental health, well-being, and will to continue distance running.
