### Running Through My Roots

Winning Poem of the Tian Hong National Cross Cultural Youth Art Contest

In the land where banyan trees prevail,<br>My ancestors’ spirits soar on Taiwan’s gale.<br>Today I stand on American ground,<br>Where my running shoes make a lonely sound.

Miles stretch before me, an endless track,<br>Two cultures on my shoulders, a burden on my back.<br>With each step, I carry a legacy—<br>One whose very essence defines me. 

I’m always in fear of being passed,<br> I run through doubt as stereotypes are cast.<br> “You’re smart AND fast!”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why can’t I just be fast?<br>“You’re going to quit after you get into a good college?”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I want to run forever. 

On the starting line, statistics stand stark and clear,<br>Less than two percent look like me here.<sup>&ast;</sup><br>In a sea of fourteen thousand runners strong,<br>Just three hundred where I belong. 

I dream of an Ekiden’s team embrace,<br>Where running’s not just a solitary race.<br>In Japan, they cheer with fervent hearts,<br>While here, we struggle to find our parts.

Now it is time; dreams must take flight,<br>We must put forward all our might.<br>In my veins flows the strength of those,<br>Who crossed the Pacific, weathering woes.

From 彰化’s mountains to San Francisco’s hills,<sup>&ast;</sup><sup>&ast;</sup><br>Our journey is long, but stronger our wills.<br>For you, I race toward horizons yet unseen,<br>Where every runner can live their dream.

Endurance learned from immigrant strife,<br>Propels me forward, gives dreams their life.<br>With every lap, every mile I go,<br>I prove we belong, we have something to show. 

For every Asian kid told they can’t,<br>I run to prove that yes, we can.<br>I carry my culture with every stride,<br>My heritage and passion, side by side.

Defying the odds, getting stronger by the hour,<br>Through running, we find our power.
