### Scanlon on Privacy: Moving Beyond the Zones

Privacy, an intangible construct, forms the very core of human dignity and autonomy. Thomas Scanlon, in his 1975 paper “Thomson on Privacy”, provides a framework to understand privacy through conventionally defined zones or territories. I will lay out Scanlon’s conception of privacy as zones of autonomy and then reevaluate their absoluteness. I will argue that understanding privacy necessitates looking beyond mere zones, viewing it as a right against the unsanctioned distribution of our personal information, with the role of intentionality emerging as a central determinant in its potential violations.

Scanlon defines privacy through the prism of conventionally demarcated zones or territories, such as one’s home or distinct social situations (Scanlon, p. 316-318). Scanlon’s perspective on privacy goes beyond the mere tangible confines of property, emphasizing its role in shielding individuals from undue scrutiny and intrusion (Scanlon, p. 315). Central to his argument is that privacy rights are not necessarily derived from other rights, as for example the zones he lays out are not necessarily determined by property rights (Scanlon, p. 316 & 318). This gives individuals not only the autonomy over their physical spaces but also the control to determine who accesses their personal realms and to what extent.

By detaching privacy from the traditional anchors of tangible assets, Scanlon emphasizes its essence as a construct deeply rooted in an individual’s authority over their personal information. Through this lens, privacy is not just spatial but is fundamentally about the power over personal information within these designated zones (Scanlon, p. 318). Hence, in Scanlon’s intricate framework, privacy stands as both a sanctuary and a testament to one’s autonomy, shielding individuals from undesired intrusions, along with the necessity of having to be alert for those intrusions (Scanlon, p. 317).

I argue that these zones, at least as Scanlon defines them, do not exist. If we dissect Scanlon’s conception of privacy zones, we unearth inherent flaws. Scanlon posits that there exists a mutual understanding between people about these zones, suggesting a uniformity and accessibility of such zones. However, real-life scenarios often contradict this idealistic view. How can we universally define these zones when every individual’s circumstances and boundaries differ? 

Consider the case of Bob, who, in a bustling urban environment and under economic constraints, shares an apartment with two roommates. The doors are old and do not fit their frames in such a way that allows sound to travel easily from room-to-room. In such a scenario, Scanlon’s conventional zones of privacy blur. If Bob wishes to engage in a private phone call, is it reasonable to expect his roommates to intentionally avoid overhearing, every single time? I think that to say Bob’s roommates owe it to him to cover their ears every time Bob picks up the phone is to ask too much of them. It cannot possibly be the case that they violate Bob’s privacy by <em>doing nothing</em> when Bob picks up the phone. 

I therefore propose that these “zones” are <em>porous constructs</em>. They are not fortresses against intrusion; they merely moderate the <em>intensity</em> and sources of such intrusion. Accepting Scanlon’s zones in their entirety would render everyday interactions fraught with potential privacy breaches—a proposition both unrealistic and untenable. To truly grapple with the intricacies of privacy, we should pivot away from fixed, absolute zones and instead embrace a <em>spectrum of control</em>. Consider this analogy: if someone were to attach their mailbox to a park bench and then leave personal letters in it, their dismay at a stranger reading them would seem misplaced. By Scanlon’s definition, these letters are safe within the person’s zone, but by placing the letters in such an open, public space, haven’t they implicitly compromised their privacy? This perspective shifts the emphasis from dictating who can access our information to recognizing our own agency in determining which “zones” we occupy and understanding their intrinsic privacy implications. 

What I have argued is that traditional, “conventional” zones are unreliable metrics to gauge the sanctity of our privacy. The permeability of these zones beckons us to reevaluate and redefine what privacy truly encapsulates. So, what really is privacy then? If we acknowledge that the stability of traditional zones is questionable at best, we need a more resilient definition. I propose that we recognize privacy as a right against <em>unsanctioned distribution</em> of our personal information, irrespective of where that information resides.

One might then point to the example of Bob and argue that, by this new definition, Bob’s roommates inadvertently accessing his personal information through overheard phone conversations constitutes a violation of his privacy. After all, isn’t overhearing technically a form of unsanctioned distribution, albeit unintentional? But this is where the nuance of <em>intentionality</em> becomes crucial. Unsanctioned distribution, in this refined understanding of privacy, necessitates a deliberate act of obtaining and then either sharing or using that information without the knowledge or permission of the individual concerned. Overhearing Bob’s conversation, especially given the constraints of their living situation, lacks the conscious intent to infringe on Bob’s privacy. It becomes an inadvertent, <em>passive</em> act rather than an <em>active</em>, malicious one. If, however, one of Bob’s roommates were to record his conversations and share them without Bob’s consent, this would clearly be a deliberate act and a violation of his privacy.

Indeed, one might still object, using Thomson’s example of someone wandering into another’s home and taking in the environment (objects, guests, etc.). In this scenario, the trespasser, though having no intention of sharing what they have seen or learned, might still be perceived as violating the homeowner’s privacy. This could be seen as a potential flaw in my argument—that the mere act of observation, without intent to distribute, can still be deemed a breach of privacy. This requires me to make a distinction. Let’s first consider the nature of the violation in this hypothetical scenario. Entering another’s domain without permission is primarily an infringement upon property rights. The act itself is trespassing. The observations made within the house could then possibly be seen as a secondary privacy violation, but it is one born out of an initial, more fundamental transgression. I would say that, because the trespasser had no right to be in the space to begin with, any subsequent violations—including breaches of privacy—are by-products of the original wrongdoing.

Especially with the growing concerns about privacy in the digital world, my argument does not answer every question. For example, how do we determine the threshold for when an unsanctioned distribution of information is truly malicious in intent? If traditional zones are indeed porous, where does that leave us in our quest for autonomy in an increasingly interconnected world? Rather, by pivoting to a focus on distribution and the motives behind it, I have offered a foundation for a more adaptable, encompassing, and standardized (across societies or cultures) understanding of privacy. This perspective not only broadens the conceptual boundaries of privacy but also brings us a step closer to addressing the contemporary challenges posed by ever-evolving technologies and societal norms.
